# Heart-Rate-Monitoring-System-
This system processes raw ECG data through matlab techniques to extract meaningful physiological information. The implementation includes low-pass and high-pass filtering for noise reduction, R-wave detection for calculating R-R intervals, and the estimation of heart rate.
